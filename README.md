    Detection, classification and localization of military and civilian vehicles, which include: 'Military Truck', 'Military Tank', 'Military Aircraft', 'Military Helicopter', 'Civilian Car' and 'Civilian Aircraft' from this <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/njdjkbxdpn/1">data</a>. The dataset is created and processed using Roboflow. For detection, a <a href="https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5">YOLOv5</a> model is trained and then the solution is evaluated using Precision, Recall, F-score and mAP (mean Average Precision). This <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/how-to-train-yolov5-on-a-custom-dataset/">guide</a> was followed to help us understand how custom object detection with YOLOv5 works.
